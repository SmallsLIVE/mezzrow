    <p>In general, the door charge to <strong>Mezzrow</strong> is <strong>$20</strong>.
      This is a charge for the music and does not include a drink.
      At certain times, at the discretion of the management, a discounted door charge will be offered.
      The student price of $10 will be offered depending on the day and show and at the discretion of the management.</p>
    <p>You may purchase a <strong>Guaranteed Seat(s)</strong> for the listening room area by clicking on the link next to
      the event’s information.  Click on the show of your choice and choose which set you’d like to purchase a seat for.
      Not all shows will offer guaranteed seats.</p>
    <p>A <strong>Guaranteed Seat</strong> insures you of a place in the front of the club at a table near the music.</p>
    <p>A purchase of a <strong>Guaranteed Seat</strong> is for <strong>One Set Only</strong>.
      You may stay for a second set depending on availability and at the discretion of the management.
      After the set is over you are welcome to remain in the lounge area for as long as you wish.</p>
    <p>The purchase of a <strong>Guaranteed Seat</strong> is <strong>Non-Refundable</strong> – please be careful to
      understand this when making your purchase.  However, if given enough time, we can transfer your seat for the
      next set or another show altogether depending on availability.  In the case of needing to transfer your seat,
      please email <a href="mailto:mezzrowclub@gmail.com">mezzrowclub@gmail.com</a> to initiate a transfer.</p>
    <p>After purchasing your <strong>Guaranteed Seat</strong> you will receive an email confirmation with your party’s
      name, the date and set time and a confirmation number.  Your name will be on a list at the door and the manager
      will show you to your seat.  There will be no paper ticket issued.</p>
    <p>We ask that you arrive early to your purchased show.  The seats in the listening room area are not assigned but
      your place is guaranteed.  We cannot insure that large parties will be able to sit together.</p>
    <p>Latecomers run the risk of losing their seats.  The management reserves the right to re-sell the seat if you
      haven’t show up within 10 minutes of the start time of the set.  We will try our best to accommodate all
      latecomers but the listening room is small.</p>
